  abstract = {Kieker is an extensible framework for monitoring and analyzing the
        runtime behavior of concurrent or distributed software systems. It
        provides measurement probes for application performance monitoring
        and control-flow tracing. Analysis plugins extract and visualize
        architectural models, augmented by quantitative observations. Configurable
        readers and writers allow Kieker to be used for online and online
        analysis. This paper reviews the Kieker framework focusing on its
        features, its provided extension points for custom components, as
        well the imposed monitoring overhead.},
