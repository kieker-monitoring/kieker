  abstract = {Observability of a software system aims at allowing its engineers
              and operators to keep the system robust and highly available.
              With this paper, we present the Kieker Observability Framework
              Version 2, the successor of the Kieker Monitoring Framework.In
              this tool artifact paper, we do not just present the Kieker
              framework, but also a demonstration of its application to the
              TeaStore benchmark, integrated with the visual analytics tool
              ExplorViz. This demo is provided both as an online service and as
              an artifact to deploy it yourself.},
