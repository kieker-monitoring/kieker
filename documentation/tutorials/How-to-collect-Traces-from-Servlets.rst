How to collect Traces from Servlets 
===================================

While we use Jetty in this tutorial, other servlet containers can also
be used. Information on them can be found in
:ref:`tutorials-how-to-apply-kieker-in-java-ee-environments`

Prerequisites
-------------

- Use Java 8 (it may work with newer versions, see below)
- Get the iObserve variant of the JPetStore from `JPetStore-6 <https://github.com/research-iobserve/jpetstore-6>`
  Use ``git clone https://github.com/research-iobserve/jpetstore-6.git``
  to obtain the JPetStore
- Download `Jetty <https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.html>`. Use
  a version which is compatible with your Java version. Kieker 1.14
  with AspectJ will not work with Java 11. This will change in the
  1.15 which supports Java 11.
