Getting Started 
===============

In this section we introduce how to work with Kieker. Starting with
methods to obtain Kieker, configure and apply Kieker, and writing your
own probes and event types. We use the small sample application
Bookstore to illustrate how to work with Kieker. However, there exists a
wide variety how to apply Kieker to applications and services. We will
only cover manual and basic AspectJ instrumentation to discuss basic
concept. There is more documentation available (:ref:`how-to-apply-insturmentation`) which
illustrates different techniques to instrument depending on the
technology.
