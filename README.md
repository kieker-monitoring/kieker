# Kieker Monitoring Framework

The internal behavior of large-scale software systems cannot be determined on the
basis of static (e.g., source code) analysis alone. Kieker provides complementary
dynamic analysis capabilities, i.e., monitoring and analyzing a software system’s
runtime behavior — enabling application performance monitoring and architecture
discovery.

Detailed information about Kieker is provided at http://kieker-monitoring.net/

## Usage

Kieker releases (stable, nightly, etc.) can be downloaded from our website's [Download Section](http://kieker-monitoring.net/download).

Documentation on how to use Kieker can be found here: [Kieker Documentation](http://kieker-monitoring.net/documentation)

## Development and Contribution

Gradle is used as the build tool. A `build.gradle` file is provided.

Further instructions for developers are available at
https://kieker-monitoring.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DEV/

### Eclipse Setup for Contributors

- Get Gradle support by installing the Eclipse plugin "Buildship: ..." in version 2 or above.
- If you have already imported Kieker in Eclipse, delete it
- Import Kieker in Eclipse by importing it as gradle project (Eclipse will also import all submodules automatically)
- Whenever you change a build.gradle file, regenerate the .project and .classpath files for Eclipse by using "Gradle->Refresh Gradle Project"

Read our [Confluence pages](https://kieker-monitoring.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/5865685/Local+Development+Environment) for more information.

### Code Conventions

### Debugging and Logging Kieker's Execution

Kieker uses the [Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J)](https://www.slf4j.org/) to support the logging framework of your choice. In order to see or store log messages, you need to [bind a logging framework](https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#swapping) at deployment time.

A fast and flexible logging framework that can be used with SLF4J is [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch). In order to use it, you have to [download](https://logback.qos.ch/download.html) it, add `logback-classic-<version>.jar` and `logback-core-<version>.jar` to the classpath.
Moreover, you have to set up a `logback.xml` file for configuration and add its containing folder to the classpath. An example of such a file is provided below:

````xml
<configuration>
  <!-- log to console -->
  <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <encoder>
      <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
    </encoder>
  </appender>
  <!-- for logging to files see: https://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html -->

  <!-- standard log level is "warn" -->
  <root level="debug">
    <appender-ref ref="WARN" />
  </root>
  <!-- set log level for TCP writer down to "info" -->
  <logger name="kieker.monitoring.writer.tcp" level="INFO" />
</configuration>
````

[Logbacks official documentation](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/index.html) provides more information on how to use and configure it.
