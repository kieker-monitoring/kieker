/**
 * Forwards incoming {@link IMonitoringRecord}s with delays computed from the {@link kieker.common.record.IMonitoringRecord#getLoggingTimestamp()} value
 * (assumed to be in the configured resolution). For example, after initialization, if records with logging timestamps 3000 and 4500 nanos are received, the
 * first record is forwarded immediately; the second will be forwarded 1500 nanos later. The acceleration factor can be used to accelerate/slow down the
 * replay (default 1.0, which means no acceleration/slow down).<br>
 * The implementation with TeeTime consists of two components: At first a consumer stage (declared as passive) which receives incoming records and
 * stores them in a queue. At second a producer stage (always active) which takes the records from the queue and forwards them with the proper delay.
 * <br>
 * <b>Note:</b> We assume that the incoming records are ordered by their timestamps. The stage does not provide an ordering mechanism. Records that are received
 * "too late" are forwarded with a delay of 0 but stay "too late".
