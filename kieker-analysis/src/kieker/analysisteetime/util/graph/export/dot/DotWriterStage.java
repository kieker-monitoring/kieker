/**
 * This stage writes a {@link IGraph} to given {@link Writer} in the dot file format. The writer
 * can be configured by a {@link Function}, which maps the graph to a writer. For example, this
 * allows one write the graph to a file with the name of the graph. For a non generic writer
 * simply use something like {@code x -> new MyWriter()}.
 *
 * In addition, this stage can be configured by a {@link DotExportConfiguration}, which specifies
 * how attributes (for graphs, vertices and edges) are mapped to the dot graph.
