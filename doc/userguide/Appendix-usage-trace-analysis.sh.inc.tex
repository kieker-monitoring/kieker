    --select-traces <id0 ... idn>
        Consider only the traces identified by the list of trace IDs.
        Defaults to all traces.

    --filter-traces <id0 ... idn>
        Consider only the traces not identified by the list of trace IDs.
        Defaults to no traces.

    --ignore-invalid-traces
        If selected, the execution aborts on the occurence of an invalid
        trace.

    --max-trace-duration <duration in ms>
        Threshold (in ms) after which incomplete traces become invalid.
        Defaults to 600,000 (i.e, 10 minutes).

        the visualizations.

    --include-self-loops
        If selected, self-loops are included in the visualizations.

    --ignore-assumed-calls
        If selected, assumed calls are visualized just as regular calls.

    --traceColoring <color map file>

        properties file (key: trace ID, value: color in hex format, e.g.,
        0xff0000 for red; use trace ID 'default' to specify the default
        color)
