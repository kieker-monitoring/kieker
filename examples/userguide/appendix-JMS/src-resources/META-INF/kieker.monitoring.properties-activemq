kieker.monitoring.writer=kieker.monitoring.writer.jms.JmsWriter
#
## The url of the jndi provider that knows the jms service
## - ActiveMQ: tcp://127.0.0.1:61616/
## - HornetQ:  jnp://localhost:1099/
## - OpenJMS:  tcp://127.0.0.1:3035/
kieker.monitoring.writer.jms.JmsWriter.ProviderUrl=tcp://127.0.0.1:61616/
#
## The topic at the jms server which is used in the publisher/subscribe communication.
kieker.monitoring.writer.jms.JmsWriter.Topic=queue1
#
## The type of the jms factory implementation, e.g.
## - ActiveMQ: org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory
## - HornetQ:  org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory
## - OpenJMS:  org.exolab.jms.jndi.InitialContextFactory
kieker.monitoring.writer.jms.JmsWriter.ContextFactoryType=org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory
#
## The service name for the jms connection factory.
kieker.monitoring.writer.jms.JmsWriter.FactoryLookupName=ConnectionFactory
#
## The time that a jms message will be kept alive at the jms server before 
## it is automatically deleted.
kieker.monitoring.writer.jms.JmsWriter.MessageTimeToLive=10000
#
## Asynchronous writers need to store monitoring records in an internal buffer.
## This parameter defines its capacity in terms of the number of records. 
kieker.monitoring.writer.jms.JmsWriter.QueueSize=10000
#
## Behavior of the asynchronous writer when the internal queue is full:
## 0: terminate Monitoring with an error (default)
## 1: writer blocks until queue capacity is available
## 2: writer discards new records until space is available
##  Be careful when using the value '1' since then, the asynchronous writer
##  is no longer decoupled from the monitored application.
kieker.monitoring.writer.jms.JmsWriter.QueueFullBehavior=0
#
## Maximum time to wait for the writer threads to finish (in milliseconds).
## A MaxShutdownDelay of -1 means infinite waiting.
kieker.monitoring.writer.jms.JmsWriter.MaxShutdownDelay=-1
