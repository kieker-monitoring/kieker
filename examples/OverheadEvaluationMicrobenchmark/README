This example contains micro benchmarks to quantify the performance
overhead caused by the Kieker framework components. 

All experiments employ AspectJ for weaving the monitoring probes 
into the application. The Java methods to be instrumented are 
selected using Java annotations.

Currently only shell (.sh) scripts are provided.

The default execution of the benchmark requires a 64Bit JVM!
This can be changed in the respective .sh scripts.

Files required in /lib:
  kieker-*_aspectj.jar         (a current build of Kieker)
  aspectjrt-*.jar
  aspectjtools-*.jar
  commons-cli-1.2.jar

Initially, the following steps are required:
1. You should check whether you installed ant (http://ant.apache.org/), 
   since the execution of all examples described in this 
   README is based on the run-targets in the ant file build.xml.
2. Make sure, that you've installed R (http://www.r-project.org/) to 
   generate the results.
3. Compile the application by calling ant.

Execution of Microbenchmark:
All benchmarks are started with calls of .sh scripts in the /bin folder.
The top of the files include some possibilities for configuration, such as
* SLEEPTIME between executions
* NUM_LOOPS number of repetions
* THREADS concurrent benchmarking threads
* MAXRECURSIONDEPTH recursion up to this depth
* TOTALCALLS the duration of the benchmark
* METHODTIME the time per monitored call
Furthermore some JVM arguments can be adjusted:
* JAVAARGS JVM Arguments

Experiments:
Different recursion depth (with MAXRECURSIONDEPTH=1 one can test without recursion)
-> bin/run-benchmark-recursive.sh

To check for a linear rise in monitoring overhead, this benchmark increses the 
recursion depth up to 2^MAXRECURSIONDEPTH in logarithmic steps
-> bin/run-benchmark-recursive-linear.sh

Benchmarking the JMX-writer
-> bin/run-benchmark-recursive-jmx.sh

The experiments run-cycle*.sh and their used files run-benchmark-cycle-*.sh are 
currently only supporting Solaris environments and require pfexec permissions to
assign subsets of cores to the benchmarking system.

Analysing the data:
in the folder /bin/r-scripts are some R scripts provided to generate graphs to
visualiaze the results. In the top the files, one can configure the required paths
and the configuration used to analyze the data.
