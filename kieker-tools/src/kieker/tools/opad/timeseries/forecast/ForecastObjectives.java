	 * have a forecast accuracy below 1 and therefore
	 * be better than a solely reactive approach
	 * using implicitly the naive strategy.
	 * This is only true in cases of nearly constant
	 * base level of the arrivals rates.
	 * These strategies should be executed as
	 * frequently as possible every new time series point.
	 * 2 = medium - CubicSmoothingSplines, ARIMA101, SimpleExponential Smoothing, Crostons method for intermittent demands:
	 * The strengths of these strategies are the
	 * low computational efforts below 100ms and their
	 * ability to extrapolate the trend component.
	 * They differ in sensitivity to noise level or
	 * seasonal components. These strategies need
	 * to be executed in a high frequency with small horizons.
	 * 3 = high - ExtendedExponential Smoothing, tBATS
	 * The computational effort for both strategies
	 * is below 30 sec for a maximum of 200 time series points.
	 * They differ in the capabilities of modeling seasonal
	 * components.
	 * 4 = very high - ARIMA, tBATS
	 * The computational effort for the ARIMA approach
	 * can reach up to 60 sec for a maximum of
	 * 200 time series points and may achieve smaller
	 * confidence intervals than the tBATS approach.
	 * 
	 * The overhead objective defines the highest overhead group
	 * from which the forecast strategies will be chosen.
	 * A value of 2 may be sufficient if the time series data
	 * have strong trend components that are not overlaid
	 * by seasonal patterns, as the strength of group 2 strategies
	 * is the trend extrapolation.
	 * For time series with seasonal patterns,
	 * a setting of 3 for a maximum forecast
	 * computation time of 30 seconds and 4 for forecast
	 * computation times below 1 minute is recommended.
