The internal behavior of large-scale software systems cannot be determined on the
basis of static (e.g., source code) analysis alone. Kieker provides complementary
dynamic analysis capabilities, i.e., monitoring and analyzing a software system’s
runtime behavior — enabling application performance monitoring and architecture
discovery.

Detailed information about Kieker is provided at http://kieker-monitoring.net/
