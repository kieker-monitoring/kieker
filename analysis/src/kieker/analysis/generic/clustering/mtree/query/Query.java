/**
 * An {@link Iterable} class which can be iterated to fetch the results of a
 * nearest-neighbors query.

 * <p>
 * The neighbors are presented in non-decreasing order from the {@code
 * queryData} argument to the {@link MTree#getNearest(Object, double, int)
 * getNearest*()}
 * call.
 *
 * <p>
 * The query on the M-Tree is executed during the iteration, as the
 * results are fetched. It means that, by the time when the <i>n</i>-th
 * result is fetched, the next result may still not be known, and the
 * resources allocated were only the necessary to identify the <i>n</i>
 * first results.

 * @param <T>
 *            data type of the values in the query result
